# QQ-Simulation
This is a simulation of social media software, including a server and a client.

First thing to do is to run QQFrame.java (which is in QQServer/src/qqframe/QQFrame.java ), and then open other window to run QQView.java (which is in QQClient/src/qqclient/view/QQView.java )

In order for clients to log in successfully, go to QQServer/src/QQServerService/QQServer.java and check the existing user, and enter the userId and password which is in that list.
